<description><![CDATA[Today on the LOL show, we do quite a lot. Not only do we run down every final matchup that mattered and cover my thoughts on the theme for next year, but I also invited Bapes on the show to recap everyone's season, one by one. You're welcome. She's real.

We wrap the show with a bunch of voicemails, as is tradition, and Blountz seems to have things slightly twisted.

Don't forget to leave voicemails throughout the offseason as you experience life without football!]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[Today on the LOL show, we recap the wild, wild, wildcard weekend, plus we run through the semi-final matchups for both levels. We then jump on a quick call with Proper Football and Smokin' Blountz about their AOL showdown. After we get those two losers off the phone, we talk to some teams with better outlooks in High Decibels and Blitzed.

We wrap the show with a single voicemail, as is tradition now since no one wants to entertain me with messages on my answering machine anymore.

<description><![CDATA[Wowwwww! We are back again with yet another episode of randomness to make your lonely Thursday evening just a little bit better. This time Proper and I welcome Smokin’ Blountz to the show to join us in our regular shenanigans!

This week, we grill Blountz over how he came to find the League of Levels, what the hell is up with him and Munchen on Bundchen, and how confident he is having just mortgaged his fantasy future to win right now.

Speaking of that, a big topic of discussion is yet another trade that went down last week, and wouldn’t ya know, it included Smokin’ Blountz and Proper Football. I let them explain themselves and we all have the pleasure of witnessing Blountz realize the keeper ramifications in real-time.

We talk about belly buttons, fantasy getaways, the cup, and I give all farm teams a serious tip heading into the trade deadline. For real, listen up, farmers.

We’ll do better next week.

Leave a voicemail and we’ll play it on the show! (407) 984-7024

<description><![CDATA[This is almost becoming too regular at this point. Maybe we should slow it down a bit and take a break.

This week, I welcome Proper (per usual) and Blitzed to the show! This was yet another freestyle show with absolutely no plans, but we managed to not completely embarrass ourselves. We hit on everything from daylight savings, AJ Green, Halloween, playoff projections, AOL projections, the Cup, and we even discussed how regardless of winning, 4th and 9 Inches is a shell of his former self. Facts.

The meat of the show, however, really centers around two amazing trades that were made in the SLFFL this week. The gang breaks down the details and potential fallout for both of these landscape-shifting moves.

<title><![CDATA[S02E05 - Chatting with the Masters: Volume II]]></title>
<description><![CDATA[Well, look at us getting another show released just a week later! The freestyle format, which is a nice way of saying unprepared, makes it much easier. Having said that, this is an ultimately random show.

We get into a bunch of different stuff like my horrible decision to bench Aaron Rodgers, Tom Brady happy endings, top NFL crimes, rugby being popular, human trafficking, most-hated LOL families, and Proper’s insistence on the Super Bowl being in London regardless of the inevitably horrible halftime show.

We also chat about some fantasy topics throughout, including some cup updates and a quick dip into the farm.

We’ll do better next week.

<itunes:summary><![CDATA[Well, look at us getting another show released just a week later! The freestyle format, which is a nice way of saying unprepared, makes it much easier. Having said that, this is an ultimately random show.

We get into a bunch of different stuff like my horrible decision to bench Aaron Rodgers, Tom Brady happy endings, top NFL crimes, rugby being popular, human trafficking, most-hated LOL families, and Proper’s insistence on the Super Bowl being in London regardless of the inevitably horrible halftime show.

We also chat about some fantasy topics throughout, including some cup updates and a quick dip into the farm.

We’ll do better next week.

Leave a voicemail and we’ll play it on the show! (407) 984-7024

<title><![CDATA[S02E04 - Chatting with the Masters: Volume I]]></title>
<description><![CDATA[This show is totally different, but in a much larger sense it’s actually exactly the same as always. This week we decided to just not plan anything. We pressed record before saying hello.

We get to quite a few topics as we ramble and ramble. We touch on our own locked matchup from last week, Proper’s trip to another NFL game, Donald Trump, Brexit, Terminator, polyester, Antonio Brown, the Cup, soccer hooligans, deep-fried turkey, and so much more.

I should probably stop with the spoilers.

We’ll be better next week.

<title><![CDATA[S02E03 - The League of Levels and Private Phone Calls]]></title>
<description><![CDATA[Well, hello! We’re back with yet another episode designed to tickle your ear bones. This one includes an exclusive private phone call delivered by a whistle-blower that’s sure to lead to an impeachment investigation.

Also on this episode, Proper Football joins Buddy to discuss the latest in NFL news from Antonio Brown going back to school to the promised one, Daniel Jones. We also get into a few storylines in the LOL with Ten Foot and Sacks being undefeated, Hernandez turning heads, and 4th really sucking in Omega.

Speaking of Omega, the main topic of today’s show is LOL101. Everything there is to know about the League of Levels and how other commissioners can apply some of these level concepts to their own friendly neighborhood leagues. From start to finish, we cover it all.

In typical fashion, we wrap it all up with another JBOTW, some shit lists, and some love lists. Nothing fancy.

We’ll be better next week.

<description><![CDATA[Once again, we’re back to bless your eardrums with a bit of hot fire just in time for your fantasy football drafts! Oh, you have already had your draft? Well, face it, you’re in a bad league.

On this episode, Ten Foot and Proper Football join Buddy Danger to discuss the latest in NFL news from Kenny Stills and Laremy Tunsel getting out of Miami to the MG3 holdout talk. Apparently, that’s what we call him now.

The meat of the show is a draft preview for the SLFFL with a side of keepers. We analyze each team’s roster and make predictions as to where they will go with their first few selections. Oh, and don’t forget to listen for some fun over-unders to help you enjoy the draft even more.

As always, we wrap up everything with our Jackie Battle of the Week, a robot voicemail, and shit/love lists.

<title><![CDATA[S02E01 - Offseason Timeline and NFC East Review]]></title>
<description><![CDATA[We’re back! I’m sure you have all been refreshing this feed for months just waiting for some new content to shove in your ears and it’s finally here! Enjoy. You’re welcome.

This season, we’re going to be trying some new things. First change, just two hosts. This episode is Buddy Danger and Proper Football. The second change, a weekly “headlines” segment with music courtesy of the illustrious High Decibels.

We have missed a TON of time since the Super Bowl, so this episode is your perfect refresher course on everything that has happened this offseason. Less about lineman signings and more about Bob Kraft and the Orchids of Asia, if you get what I’m saying.

We cover everything from the Super Bowl, to Antonio Brown, to NFL insurance claims, to Dave Gettleman, and we even sprinkle a little Colin Kaepernick on top. It’s a heater.

After a quick commercial break from the world’s best sponsors, we cover the NFC East very thoroughly thanks to Proper Football’s obsession with the league’s oddest division.

We wrap it up as usual with a Jackie Battle of the Offseason and a pair of shit and love lists that are guaranteed to cheer you up during our time without football.

We’ll be better next week.

<title><![CDATA[S01E22 - Super Bowl Extravaganza Special]]></title>
<description><![CDATA[We were just too excited about the big game to not do a show this week. I realize this is late in the week, but this is intended to replace whatever garbage they feed you on CBS this afternoon.

In this episode, I have Proper Football as usual, but I actually have an in-studio guest too! High Decibels has traveled down to Orlando for work and decided to stick around for some fantasy shenanigans.

We try to cover everything there is to know about the Super Bowl. We talk about weed commercials and CBS being horrible. We talk about the national anthem and how Gladys Knight will surely make this all about her. We even find time to discuss halftime, concessions, ticket prices, and advertising!

It’s more of a rambling mess of a show, but we do manage to have a conversation about instant replay and challenging pass interference calls.

I’m not really sure we even had a JBOTW, but we did wrap everything up with shit lists and love lists. Oh, and we threw actual Super Bowl predictions out there at some point.

Enjoy your Super Bowl Sunday, even though it should be Super Bowl Saturday, but that’s another topic for another time.

<description><![CDATA[We’re back and we’re just as surprised as you! I would have loved nothing more than just not doing anything, but we have paying customers now. This is quickly becoming a job.

Regardless, we have a fantastic show for you this week! I have Proper Football and Ten Foot with me and we rundown a bunch of NFL news and playoff results, we dish some new ideas for fantasy prize payouts, and we cover both of the league’s championship finishes.

Speaking of the SLFFL, we describe in detail a laughable story of two people afraid of being relegated and how an elected Illuminati could help your league too.

Congrats to Smokin’ Blountz for being promoted to the main league! I may have never met him, but we’re connected through a Chubb. That’s what she said.

We round out the show with our typical JBOTW, shit lists, and love lists, but we add something special at the end. Fantasy new year’s resolutions! We all have a few personal things we plan on doing differently in 2019. Spoiler alert, mine has to do with Cleveland.

<title><![CDATA[S01E20 - Fantasy Championships and Magical Christmas Questions]]></title>
<description><![CDATA[Ho, ho, ho! We’re back again for a special Fantasy Championship & Christmas Extravaganza all jam packed into one episode. Fresh for your beautiful ears, we have Proper Football and 4th and 9 Inches rounding out the line-up.

In this episode, we hit the NFL news pretty hard. I looked down at the clock and we apparently just covered everything there was to cover. After moving on from that, we got into side-games that we like to play during the off-season to accrue more fantasy balls for the sack of destiny.

Speaking of the sack of destiny, it makes an appearance this week by providing us with some much needed Christmas questions to ponder and debate. The real talk hits when we discuss the best presents we ever received.

We wrap of the festivities by covering both league championships in detail. We are overly excited about the prospect of a Smokin’ Blountz promotion, but according to our voicemail from the UK it’s the dumbest team name ever. Fuck that guy.

After all of that non-sense, obviously we put a bow on it with a worthy JBOTW, some online shopping themed shit lists, and a special surprise love list that will leave you shocked!

<title><![CDATA[S01E19 - Early Salutations & Off-Season Preparations]]></title>
<description><![CDATA[Woah. Two episodes in one week was way more work than anticipated. Not only did we pull it off, but we bring you two different co-hosts. Proper Football and Blitzed!

In this episode, we prepare for the off-season. We understand that the majority of fantasy football contestants are no longer in their respective playoffs. Most people are checked out. We decided to throw out some tips for those of you looking at 2019.

We also, on a similar note, discuss in detail what leagues should do about teams that check out far too early. We share examples of how this causes ripple effects in your league. It really does need to be vaccinated out of fantasy forever, and we’re here to help.

This show is full of a bunch of other random shit that we stumbled on and we kick it off with a heavy dose of NFL headlines from around the league. My apologies for the heavy pre-game Chiefs/Chargers takes that are not so timely now.

At the end of the episode, Proper and Blitzed try to shit talk, but end up hugging it out. They don’t know how to playoff at all.

We wrap everything up, per usual, with our JBOTW, shit lists, and love lists. Fairly standard.

Big ups for downloading. We really appreciate it.

<title><![CDATA[S01E18 - Fantasy Newcast, Payout Structures, and End-of-Season Strategy]]></title>
<description><![CDATA[The playoffs are still here! We continue the festivities by trying to ignore them completely. Most of you aren’t in the playoffs anymore, so we figured it would be smart to talk about something else. League punishment ideas!

In this episode, we bring in 4th and 9 Inches once again and we bring back Ten Foot for the first time in quite awhile. Buddy and 4th have a serious semi-final match-up on the horizon, so obviously that comes up at one point or another.

Also, we get some live news from Hammerville, we list about one-hundred different league punishment ideas, we debate the perfect payout structures, we complain about amendments that didn’t pass in the summer, and we discuss match-up strategy and end-of-season strategy for keeper and non-keeper leagues.

After all of that we jump into the Farm where we actually cover the bottom 4 teams and debate if the Farm AOL should be punished. Spoiler: Yes, they should.

We wrap things up with the usual trifecta of the Jackie Battle of the Week, Shit Lists, and Love Lists. Oh, you’ll also notice that 4th finally got a decent microphone and doesn’t sound like he’s in a fishbowl anymore.

Watch out for another episode tomorrow!

<itunes:summary><![CDATA[The playoffs are still here! We continue the festivities by trying to ignore them completely. Most of you aren’t in the playoffs anymore, so we figured it would be smart to talk about something else. League punishment ideas!

In this episode, we bring in 4th and 9 Inches once again and we bring back Ten Foot for the first time in quite awhile. Buddy and 4th have a serious semi-final match-up on the horizon, so obviously that comes up at one point or another.

Also, we get some live news from Hammerville, we list about one-hundred different league punishment ideas, we debate the perfect payout structures, we complain about amendments that didn’t pass in the summer, and we discuss match-up strategy and end-of-season strategy for keeper and non-keeper leagues.

After all of that we jump into the Farm where we actually cover the bottom 4 teams and debate if the Farm AOL should be punished. Spoiler: Yes, they should.

We wrap things up with the usual trifecta of the Jackie Battle of the Week, Shit Lists, and Love Lists. Oh, you’ll also notice that 4th finally got a decent microphone and doesn’t sound like he’s in a fishbowl anymore.

Watch out for another episode tomorrow!

<title><![CDATA[S01E17 - The Fantasy Playoff Preview Special]]></title>
<description><![CDATA[The playoffs are here! We kick off the festivities, obviously, with a eulogy for those that we have lost. We don’t honor their effort as that would be pointless. Instead, we thank them for the easy victories.

I’m not sure why, but we invited 4th and 9 Inches back on the show. Fishbowl microphone and all. Sorry about all that.

In this fresh episode, we focus almost strictly on playoffs. We take it in multiple directions by discussing different fantasy playoff formats and the idea of promotion and relegation. We also talk about playoffs from the perspective of someone with a bye week. Oh, and we try to answer the question of what happens to the worst team in your lowest league.

After all of that, we get into the farm playoffs and display our extreme level of support for Smokin’ Blountz. He has his hands full with Jackhammer and a few others, but the guy has some confidence… and a Chubb.

We ditch the farm for the main league where we chop it up over the first-round action. Buddy Danger goes up against Connecticut Coheeds while the fan-favorites Proper Football and High Decibels square off. We let the debates rage.

We close things out with a JBOTW that Jackie Battle would not be proud of, a few pathetic shit lists, and a couple of love lists that you’ll probably just fast-forward through. I get it.

WELCOME TO THE PLAYOFFS, SCUMBAGS.

<title><![CDATA[S01E16 - Fantasy Football in Space, Fourth Down, and Playoff Scrambles]]></title>
<description><![CDATA[Look, I don’t know why we did it, but let’s just get over it and move on.

We invited 4th and 9 Inches on the show to fill in for just about everyone else in the universe that seemed to turned us down this week. Look, it is what it is and now the eternal question of “what would that be like” has been satisfied, but I guess that’s subjective.

In this episode, we blast off to the playoffs and experience not only multiple g-forces, but also fantasy football in spaaaaaaaaace! Shoutout to High Decibels. This guy should win an Emmy for podcast producing. Is that a thing?

After the alcohol entered the bloodstreams, we decided to cover quite a few NFL injury topics,  AnyGivenSundae (surprise) in the farm, a whopping three voicemails, and even a little conversation about how one loser not setting a lineup can wreak havoc across a playoff positioning battle. Fuck quitters, amiright?

Yet again we wrap it up with a JBOTW that actually did nothing last week, shit lists that include a discussion on fantasy payout breakdowns, and three love lists that include cities as vehicles, whisky, and sneakers. Spoiler alert.

<description><![CDATA[Happy Thanksgiving! For us, it’s currently Super Bowl Monday and we’re celebrating with another episode of the Internet’s favorite new podcast! I mean, we’re at least in the top million or so.

This week, we chat about the Super Bowl favorites, we speak nerd on how to calculate playoff odds, and we’re constantly interrupted by a gobble. We did have a voicemail, but holy shit, it’s really just low effort. Do better.

We reached into the Fantasy Sack of Destiny to pull special Thanksgiving questions. We definitely learn a few things about ourselves. We also mostly talk about food, but that’s okay.

We spend another week gushing over Smoking Blountz in the farm. I really think we’re just trying to wish him into (promotion) existence. Smoke it up, farm!

The main league is distracted by a Super Bowl Monday, so we basically fail at a recap. Proper Football is absolutely positive that he won’t win. Spoiler alert: he does. Sorry, Blitzed, but I called it.

Obviously, we wrap everything up with a broken JBOTW three-way, three awful shit lists, and three thoughtful love lists.

Happy Thanksgiving, scumbags!

<description><![CDATA[This week, we decide to stuff way too much content into a bite-size episode. We want to get things moving a little quicker and this should help. Less rambles, more hot takes!

Having said that, we were ultra prepared for this episode and breezed through a ton of different topics. We covered everything from playoff races, playoff formats, incentivizing trades, best league punishments, and we even found time for a few voicemails.

We recapped the farm by just gushing over Smoking Blountz and his amazing season. Not much else going on there right now. Jackhammer is still jackhammering, but Blountz is currently hot boxing the barn.

The main league recap is focused on Holding Court… for positive reasons! After actually having to go to fantasy court, she has really turned things around. I mean, she ain’t making the playoffs, but at this point I would bet on her against Towelie.

We wrap everything up with a sad JBOTW, some extra stinky shit lists, and some delightful love lists. BOOYAAHH, I love you!

<description><![CDATA[In this week’s episode, Proper Football expresses his depression on the therapy couch, we take a deep dive on Buddy Danger’s amazing week, and we welcome Connecticut Coheeds to the show for the first time!

It was yet another haphazard show. Everything was thrown together immediately prior to recording, but Coheeds was awesome to drop everything and join us. Ignore his shitty microphone. He did us a solid.

We talk plenty about Coheeds and the whole Coheeds family. We jump in the farm where we bitch about AnyGivenSundae. We recap a handful of important games from the main league. Oh yeah, we also fill you in on who won last week’s horror villain draft.

As always, we wrap up the show with a throwback JBOTW where we end up complaining more about the reaction than the action. Don’t worry, we obviously have a few shit lists and love lists.

I guess that’s everything. I don’t know. I’m leaving for the airport in about six hours, so I’m out of it. BOOYAAHH, don’t fail me!

<description><![CDATA[It’s Halloween! Well, it was just Halloween and you’re listening to this after, but still… Yay!

This week we have Buddy Danger taking the family on a trick-or-treating adventure, the crew holds a horror villain draft, and we tangent on every possible topic other than last week’s matchups.

We do spend a little time in the farm where we properly blast Jackhammer for being jackhammered by München on Bündchen. Oh and we chat about just how blue Blue Ballerz balls are getting as he just can’t seem to score.

Next week, Ten Foot has to go up against both Proper Football and Buddy Danger, so we talk a little trash leading into those pivotal games. Oh, and on that note, we debate the schedule format and drunkenly try to come up with solutions. Spoiler alert: we don’t.

We wrap everything up with a semi-deserving JBOTW, some really frustrating shit lists, and a couple lovely love lists.

<description><![CDATA[The rotating chair continues to rotate as we swap Blitzed out for Ten Foot… again. Proper Football is back and we get into last week’s madness.

Before we dive into the actual game recaps, we hold court for Holding Court, we bullshit for a bit about traveling for work, and we run through a few unique voicemails.

First of all, shoutout to everyone that dropped us a line, but more importantly, thanks to the anonymous caller that really opened my eyes and made me question fantasy football in general. Well done.

We jumped in the farm and were not surprised to find Jackhammer still jackhammering things. It’s a mess. In all seriousness, farm, get your shit together.

In the main league, we cover Proper’s huge win with 156 points, BOOYAAHH’s miraculous victory with 131 points, and AOL’s laughable 81 point thievery.

The Jackie Battle of the Week was contentious, so we decided to put it to a vote. Head over to our Twitter page to vote on this week’s JBOTW!

Obviously, we wrap up everything with our shit and love lists. Spoiler alert, Proper had a hell of a time getting tickets to an NFL game in London.

<description><![CDATA[Ask and you shall receive! We are joined once again by the illustrious Proper Football live from across the pond. Oh, and Blitzed is back with his shitty tin can microphone. Ten Foot is off flying somewhere again.

In this episode, we try to get into the NBA, but we quickly realize that will likely never happen the way I would want it to happen. Let’s just say British people apparently aren’t into basketball. It’s a small sample size (1) but it’s all I’ve got to base this on.

We get into the stinky farm and talk about someone we haven’t mentioned yet; Blue Ballerz. We cover the jackhammering epidemic the barn of scared animals is experiencing by none other than the one they call Jackhammer. Ironic, right?

Obviously, we cover the comeback failures of Bapes and Buddy Danger in the main league as well as Proper Football’s not-so-proper locking of AOL 4 Life.

The Jackie Battle of the Week is something to stick around for. We haven’t done this before. Hold on to your butts.

We end everything with our shit and love lists followed by a delectable British recipe that you’ll be smashing your rewind buttons to write down.

Oh, sorry for the mouth-breathing. It’s an Indiana thing.

<description><![CDATA[Oh, we have a hot bag for you scumbags this week. None other than Proper Football joins the show to discuss his recent locking of Buddy Danger. Not to mention, he replaces Blitzed this week, so win-win-win.

We get into some trade talk at a macro-level and we dive into the new new idea of player rentals. Plenty of locks and balls to discuss and we preview (the now complete) waiver claims of the week.

Farm talk is focused on Jackhammer and all his jackhammering. Rather impressive, but the farm still smells and we bounce pretty quickly.

Big rundown of two huge games from last week and one completely embarrassing one. I’ll let you guess the horrible game. Their team names rhyme with Schmay-OL and Hoopla.

We wrap up the show with the Jackie Battle of the Week. Oh, and don’t forget about the shit and love lists.

Leave a voicemail and we’ll play it on the show! (407) 984-7024

<title><![CDATA[S01E08 - Postmortems, Previews, and Prestigious Press Conferences]]></title>
<description><![CDATA[Calling all scumbags! We have another hot bag for your headphones!

This week is a bit different. First of all, the Internet here in Florida apparently is the poops all of the sudden, so we deal with a few technical difficulties.

We have ourselves a press conference that I certainly won’t spoil here.

After the nonsense, we drove to the farm and analyzed the standings. We found out just how bad it smells there and that somehow someone named “Talk to the Hand” is running everything. What a crazy world, amiright?

After the continued nonsense, we get into the meat of the show where we recap a few games from last week and preview one ultra important game for the upcoming weekend’s slate of SLFFL match-ups.

Oh, and we ramble about a crazy week of locks, a crazy week of waivers, and a crazy four weeks of offensive production.

<title><![CDATA[S01E07 - Week Four Predictions & Roster Amendments]]></title>
<description><![CDATA[Another week, another mess of an episode. We are once again without Ten Foot, but Buddy and Blitzed are blessed with the league's calming voice of reason, High Decibels.

We spend a little time in the farm where we ruin our brand new Yeezys and learn that they literally sleep in poop. Speaking of poop, we talk about the proper ways to use the word "blowout."

We preview the upcoming weekend of games for the SLFFL and give our predictions for some key matchups.

We wrap with the usual JBOTW and our shit/love lists, but we also throw in some discussions on future roster amendments.

Spoiler alert: I found another kicker hater! ]]></description>

<title><![CDATA[S01E06 - Week Two Recap & Ten Foot Vanishes]]></title>
<description><![CDATA[What’s up, scumbags? We’re back for another episode of that crystal clear fantasy clarity that you’re used to. Get your straws and mirrors out, so you can snort this content before the upcoming NFL weekend.

We’re missing Ten Foot. Just about everything went wrong for him last week, so he has run away. Of course, he’s saying it’s work related, but we know the deal. Regardless, we talk about Ten Foot’s “me too moment” without him.

We sympathize with Blue Ballerz for his huge farm loss and we cover the entire main league.

4th and 9 Inches is undefeated, folks. This shit isn’t cool. This shit isn’t funny. All hands on deck.

We award the Jackie Battle of the Week (JBOTW) and we throw down our shit and love lists to send you into your weekend.]]></description>

<title><![CDATA[S01E05 - Week One Recap & Lavish Locks]]></title>
<description><![CDATA[Two huge shows in the same week? Yep.

We played catch-up by recording two episodes. This one brings us up to present day with a complete recap of the first week… and by complete, I mean farm too. We cover everything, bitches!

Other than the typical shit-talking, we also introduced some new segments. We now officially have a “Jackie Battle of the Week” and we’re introducing “Shit List / Love List” which you will all shit on, yet secretly love.

We also sprinkle in some tips and tricks for other leagues. Lock systems, double-headers, and more. You can either tell your commissioners to enact these things or you can be perpetually jelly.

That’s about it. If you enjoy Buddy Danger complaining about his team while Ten Foot and Blitzed boast about their amazing weekends, this show is for you.

Shoutout to High Decibels for the production and editing.]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[We are back, motherfuckers! No more weddings, no more flights, no more bullshit. We have a full house in this episode with Buddy, Ten Foot, and Blitzed.

This is our official draft recap. You can take this to your grave. These are the definitive hot takes that your body requires after such an amazing pair of drafts. Yeah, that’s right. I said drafts because we’re also covering the damn farm.

There isn’t time for much else. This episode is packed with draft breakdowns for each and every team.

We also cover the elephant in the airport as far as Ten Foot’s draft is concerned. I’m pretty sure we’re cool, but I’m still sleeping with a rusty revolver in my nightstand.

We’ll be back tomorrow with a rundown of the first week of action in our first edition of an old school weekly recap.]]></description>

<title><![CDATA[S01E03 - High Draft Decibels Preview]]></title>
<description><![CDATA[Well, we tried. We did our best. We attempted to be an actual fantasy football podcast and breakdown a mock draft. We made it through two rounds before quitting.

Honestly, I just wanted something to release on draft day as a potential distraction.

Ten Foot and Blitzed aren't on this surprise episode. They're busy traveling. Instead, I've brought in an OG member of the league, High Decibels.

We talk shit about the draft and mock the first two rounds... poorly. If I learned anything, it's that entering keepers in a mock is cool, but it does absolutely nothing.

Look for a draft recap episode on Wednesday morning!]]></description>
